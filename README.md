# 📌 1. Project Overview

This is a Spring Boot-based backend for a multi-role e-commerce platform, built on a layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository).
The project is designed as an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and covers core features like:

✅ User Management
✅ Seller Management
✅ Product Catalog
✅ Order Processing
✅ Secure Payments (future)

# 🏗️ 4. Design & Domain Modeling

## 4.1 Architecture

* Controller (API Layer) → REST endpoints

* Service (Business Logic) → Validations, rules, transactions

* Repository (Data Access) → Database operations via Spring Data JPA


## 4.2 Key Design Choices

🔒 Role-Based Security with Spring Security

📦 DTOs to protect entities and structure responses

🔄 @Transactional Services for data consistency

⚠️ Global Exception Handling via @RestControllerAdvice

📜 AOP Logging for method tracing & performance tracking


## 4.3 Core Entities

* User
* Role
* Seller
* Product
* Categories
* Order & OrderItem
* Payment
* Review
* Cart & CartItem
* ShippingAddress
* Wishlist & WishlistItem
* Commission

# 🧪 6. Testing Strategy

* Unit Tests with JUnit + Mockito

* Service layer tested in isolation (mock repositories)

* Ensures correctness of business logic without DB dependency

# 🌟 7. Future Enhancements

* 🤖 **AI-Powered Recommendations & Virtual Try-On** (An AI/ML feature allowing users to upload their photo and visualize how fashion products (e.g., clothing, accessories) would look on them, enhancing the shopping experience.)
  
* 🕶️ **AR/VR Support for immersive shopping** (An Augmented/Virtual Reality feature that allows users to visualize products (like apparel or furniture) in their own space in real-time using their device's camera.)

* 🔑 JWT Authentication for stateless sessions

* 💳 Payment Gateway Integration (Stripe, Razorpay)

* 📊 Admin Dashboard (analytics, approvals, insights)

* 🎟️ Discount & Coupon System

* 🐳 Dockerized Deployment (AWS / Heroku)
